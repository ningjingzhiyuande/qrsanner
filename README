QR scanner
----------

Ruby Gem which wraps ZXing QR decoder library (C++) and ImageMagick



Usage
-----

Example:

First, gem install 'qrscanner'.  This also provides you with a command-line
tool ("qrscanner") for testing.

  require 'qrscanner'

  QrScanner.decode '/path/to/hellworld.png'
  => "Hello, world"

The parameter accepts any image format that ImageMagick supports, which
should include PDF for scanned documents as well as PNG/JPG/TIFF/etc.

Returns nil if it can't find a qr code or other error.  It currently prints
the error to STDERR.




Dependencies
------------

* Python (for ZXing build script)
* ImageMagick: libMagick++, libMagickWand, libMagickCore
* gcc, g++, libstd++
* Operating system with a PREFIX of "/usr".

This last one means it really only works on Linux eg. Ubuntu, and not OSX or
BSD, because the ZXing CPP build script has hard coded paths for include
files etc.  :-(
